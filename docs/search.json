    "text": "Download data\nWhile you can always download data from the AD Portal website via your web browser, it’s usually faster and often more convenient to download data programmatically.\n\nDownload a single file\nTo download a single file from the AD Knowledge Portal, you can click the linked file name to go to a page in the Synapse platform where that file is stored. Using the synID on that page, you can call the syn.get() function to download the file.\n\nExercise 1: Use Explore Data to find processed RNAseq data from the Jax.IU.Pitt_5XFAD Study\nThis filters the table to a single file. In the “Id” column for this htseqcounts_5XFAD.txt file, there is a unique Synapse ID (synID).\n\nWe can then use that synID to download the file.\n\ncounts_id =\"syn22108847\"\n\ncounts_file = syn.get(counts_id, downloadLocation = \"files/\")\n\nThe variable counts_file is a Synapse entity object. It has a variety of attributes, including .path, .properties, and .annotations that contain information about where the file is in Synapse, how it is labeled, what version it is, etc.\n\n# this is the entity's synID\n\ncounts_file.id\n\n'syn22108847'\n\n\n\n# the local path where the file was download\n\ncounts_file.path \n\n'/Users/alinden/Desktop/sage-repos/originals/ADPortalWorkshops/files/htseqcounts_5XFAD(1).txt'\n\n\n\n# the file version\n\ncounts_file.properties.versionNumber\n\n2\n\n\n\n\n\nBulk download files\n\nExercise 2: Use Explore Studies to find all metadata files from the Jax.IU.Pitt_5XFAD study\nUse the facets and search bar to look for data you want to download from the AD Knowledge Portal. Once you’ve identified the files you want, click on the download arrow icon on the top right of the Explore Data table and select “Programmatic Options” from the drop-down menu.\n\nIn the window that pops up, select the “Python” tab from the top menu bar. This will display some Python code that constructs a SQL query of the Synapse data table that drives the AD Knowledge Portal. This query will allow us to download only the files that meet our search criteria.\nThe function syn.tableQuery() returns query results as CSV file that is automatically downloaded to a Synapse cache directory .synapseCache in your home directory. You can use query.filepath to see the path to the file in the Synapse cache.\n\n# download the results of the filtered table query\n\nquery = syn.tableQuery(\"SELECT * FROM syn11346063.37 WHERE ( ( `study` HAS ( 'Jax.IU.Pitt_5XFAD' ) ) AND ( `resourceType` = 'metadata' ) )\")\n\n# view the file path of the resulting csv\n\nquery.filepath\n\n'/Users/alinden/.synapseCache/240/124439240/SYNAPSE_TABLE_QUERY_124439240.csv'\n\n\nWe’ll use the pandas function read.csv to read the CSV file as a data frame. We can explore the download_table object and see that it contains information on all of the AD Portal data files we want to download. Some columns like the “id” and “parentId” columns contain info about where the file is in Synapse, and some columns contain AD Portal annotations for each file, like “dataType”, “specimenID”, and “assay”. This annotation table will later allow us to link downloaded files to additional metadata variables!\n\n# read in the table query csv file\n\ndownload_table = pd.read_csv(query.filepath)\ndownload_table\n\n\n\n\n\n  \n    \n      \n      ROW_ID\n      ROW_VERSION\n      ROW_ETAG\n      id\n      name\n      study\n      dataType\n      assay\n      organ\n      tissue\n      ...\n      currentVersion\n      benefactorId\n      projectId\n      modifiedOn\n      modifiedBy\n      dataFileHandleId\n      metaboliteType\n      chromosome\n      modelSystemType\n      libraryPrep\n    \n  \n  \n    \n      0\n      22094731\n      2\n      84e4bc38-9fb4-429a-a9c0-117e49b26307\n      syn22094731\n      Jax.IU.Pitt_5XFAD_assay_autorad_metadata.csv\n      [\"Jax.IU.Pitt_5XFAD\"]\n      [\"image\"]\n      [\"autoradiography\"]\n      NaN\n      NaN\n      ...\n      2\n      syn2580853\n      syn2580853\n      1634772340295\n      3420438\n      75355920\n      NaN\n      NaN\n      animal\n      NaN\n    \n    \n      1\n      22094732\n      2\n      266ec572-1c42-4880-8071-58fb4bafd61d\n      syn22094732\n      Jax.IU.Pitt_5XFAD_assay_PET_metadata.csv\n      [\"Jax.IU.Pitt_5XFAD\"]\n      [\"image\"]\n      [\"Positron Emission Tomography\"]\n      NaN\n      NaN\n      ...\n      2\n      syn2580853\n      syn2580853\n      1634772340339\n      3420438\n      75355925\n      NaN\n      NaN\n      animal\n      NaN\n    \n    \n      2\n      22103212\n      3\n      7229ee91-435e-4c26-b9c1-ab623125f65e\n      syn22103212\n      Jax.IU.Pitt_5XFAD_individual_metadata.csv\n      [\"Jax.IU.Pitt_5XFAD\"]\n      NaN\n      NaN\n      NaN\n      NaN\n      ...\n      3\n      syn2580853\n      syn2580853\n      1642645133885\n      3427512\n      87202568\n      NaN\n      NaN\n      animal\n      NaN\n    \n    \n      3\n      22103213\n      3\n      ce970c4c-d929-4e55-828e-5b298a59c204\n      syn22103213\n      Jax.IU.Pitt_5XFAD_biospecimen_metadata.csv\n      [\"Jax.IU.Pitt_5XFAD\"]\n      NaN\n      NaN\n      NaN\n      NaN\n      ...\n      3\n      syn2580853\n      syn2580853\n      1634772352884\n      3420438\n      75356382\n      NaN\n      NaN\n      animal\n      NaN\n    \n    \n      4\n      22110328\n      4\n      20cf3097-4cb0-4507-9e59-1087c3c9ab71\n      syn22110328\n      Jax.IU.Pitt_5XFAD_assay_RNAseq_metadata.csv\n      [\"Jax.IU.Pitt_5XFAD\"]\n      [\"geneExpression\"]\n      [\"rnaSeq\"]\n      NaN\n      NaN\n      ...\n      4\n      syn2580853\n      syn2580853\n      1634772370968\n      3420438\n      75357585\n      NaN\n      NaN\n      animal\n      NaN\n    \n  \n\n5 rows × 45 columns\n\n\n\nFinally, we can use a for loop to loop through the “id” column and apply the syn.get() function to each file’s synID.\n\n# loop through the column of synIDs and download each file\n\nfor id in download_table.id:\n  syn.get(id, downloadLocation = \"files/\")\n\nCongratulations, you have bulk downloaded files from the AD Knowledge Portal!"

Each specimenID represents a unique sample. We can use some tools from pandas to explore the metadata.\n\n# how many unique specimens were sequenced?\n\nrna_meta['specimenID'].nunique()\n\n72\n\n\n\n# were the samples all sequenced on the same platform, and in the same\n# sequencing batch?\n\nrna_meta[['platform', 'sequencingBatch']].nunique()\n\nplatform           1\nsequencingBatch    1\ndtype: int64\n\n\n\n\nBiospecimen metadata\nThe biospecimen metadata contains specimen-level information, including organ and tissue the specimen was taken from, how it was prepared, etc. Each specimenID is mapped to an individualID.\n\n# all specimens from the RNAseq assay metadata file should be in the biospecimen\n# file\n\nrna_meta['specimenID'].isin(bio_meta['specimenID']).value_counts()\n\nTrue    72\nName: specimenID, dtype: int64\n\n\n\n# but the biospecimen file also contains specimens from different assays\n\nbio_meta['specimenID'].isin(rna_meta['specimenID']).value_counts()\n\nFalse    502\nTrue      72\nName: specimenID, dtype: int64\n\n\n\n\nIndividual metadata\nThe individual metadata contains information about all the individuals in the study, represented by unique individualIDs. For humans, this includes information on age, sex, race, diagnosis, etc. For MODEL-AD mouse models, the individual metadata has information on model genotypes, stock numbers, diet, and more.\n\n# all individualIDs in the biospecimen file should be in the individual file\n\nbio_meta['individualID'].isin(ind_meta['individualID']).value_counts()\n\n# which model genotypes are in this study?\n\nind_meta['genotype'].unique()\n\narray(['5XFAD_carrier', '5XFAD_noncarrier'], dtype=object)\n\n\n\n\nJoining metadata\nWe use the three-file structure for our metadata because it allows us to store metadata for each study in a tidy format. Every line in the assay and biospecimen files represents a unique specimen, and every line in the individual file represents a unique individual. This means the files can be easily joined by specimenID and individualID to get all levels of metadata that apply to a particular data file. We will use the merge() function from pandas, with the how = \"left\" option to specify a left join.\n\n# join all the rows in the assay metadata that have a match in the biospecimen\n# metadata, then join all the rows in that dataframe to all rows that have a\n# match in the individual metadata\n\njoined_meta = rna_meta.merge(bio_meta, how = \"left\", on = \"specimenID\").merge(ind_meta, how = \"left\", on = \"individualID\")\n\njoined_meta\n\n\n\n\n\n  \n    \n      \n      specimenID\n      platform\n      RIN\n      rnaBatch\n      libraryBatch\n      sequencingBatch\n      libraryPrep\n      libraryPreparationMethod\n      isStranded\n      readStrandOrigin\n      ...\n      Generation\n      AnimalMatingStatus\n      Comments\n      jobNumber\n      Microchip Number\n      Diet\n      Birth ID\n      brainWeight\n      animalWeight\n      modelCommonName\n    \n  \n  \n    \n      0\n      32043rh\n      IlluminaNovaseq6000\n      NaN\n      1\n      1\n      1\n      polyAselection\n      NaN\n      false\n      NaN\n      ...\n      N1F3\n      Virgin\n      NaN\n      JAX 5xFAD 12mo\n      288646853.0\n      6%\n      NaN\n      0.503\n      28.76\n      5XFAD\n    \n    \n      1\n      32044rh\n      IlluminaNovaseq6000\n      NaN\n      1\n      1\n      1\n      polyAselection\n      NaN\n      false\n      NaN\n      ...\n      N1F3\n      Virgin\n      NaN\n      JAX 5xFAD 12mo\n      289822454.0\n      6%\n      NaN\n      0.482\n      46.51\n      5XFAD\n    \n    \n      2\n      32046rh\n      IlluminaNovaseq6000\n      NaN\n      1\n      1\n      1\n      polyAselection\n      NaN\n      false\n      NaN\n      ...\n      N1F3\n      Virgin\n      NaN\n      JAX 5xFAD 12mo\n      289859181.0\n      6%\n      NaN\n      0.470\n      41.00\n      5XFAD\n    \n    \n      3\n      32047rh\n      IlluminaNovaseq6000\n      NaN\n      1\n      1\n      1\n      polyAselection\n      NaN\n      false\n      NaN\n      ...\n      N1F3\n      Virgin\n      NaN\n      JAX 5xFAD 12mo\n      289777416.0\n      6%\n      NaN\n      0.454\n      42.89\n      5XFAD\n    \n    \n      4\n      32049rh\n      IlluminaNovaseq6000\n      NaN\n      1\n      1\n      1\n      polyAselection\n      NaN\n      false\n      NaN\n      ...\n      N1F4\n      Virgin\n      NaN\n      JAX 5xFAD 12mo\n      288770010.0\n      6%\n      NaN\n      0.489\n      29.96\n      5XFAD\n    \n    \n      ...\n      ...\n      ...\n      ...\n      ...\n      ...\n      ...\n      ...\n      ...\n      ...\n      ...\n      ...\n      ...\n      ...\n      ...\n      ...\n      ...\n      ...\n      ...\n      ...\n      ...\n      ...\n    \n    \n      67\n      46886rh\n      IlluminaNovaseq6000\n      NaN\n      1\n      1\n      1\n      polyAselection\n      NaN\n      false\n      NaN\n      ...\n      N1F4\n      Virgin\n      NaN\n      JAX DMP 5xFAD 6month\n      NaN\n      6%\n      NaN\n      0.433\n      24.23\n      5XFAD\n    \n    \n      68\n      46889rh\n      IlluminaNovaseq6000\n      NaN\n      1\n      1\n      1\n      polyAselection\n      NaN\n      false\n      NaN\n      ...\n      N1F4\n      Virgin\n      NaN\n      JAX DMP 5xFAD 6month\n      NaN\n      6%\n      NaN\n      0.452\n      30.94\n      5XFAD\n    \n    \n      69\n      46890rh\n      IlluminaNovaseq6000\n      NaN\n      1\n      1\n      1\n      polyAselection\n      NaN\n      false\n      NaN\n      ...\n      N1F4\n      Virgin\n      NaN\n      JAX DMP 5xFAD 6month\n      NaN\n      6%\n      NaN\n      0.424\n      32.50\n      5XFAD\n    \n    \n      70\n      46892rh\n      IlluminaNovaseq6000\n      NaN\n      1\n      1\n      1\n      polyAselection\n      NaN\n      false\n      NaN\n      ...\n      N1F4\n      Virgin\n      NaN\n      JAX DMP 5xFAD 6month\n      NaN\n      6%\n      NaN\n      0.491\n      30.54\n      5XFAD\n    \n    \n      71\n      46896rh\n      IlluminaNovaseq6000\n      NaN\n      1\n      1\n      1\n      polyAselection\n      NaN\n      false\n      NaN\n      ...\n      N1F4\n      Virgin\n      NaN\n      JAX DMP 5xFAD 4month\n      NaN\n      6%\n      NaN\n      0.499\n      28.78\n      5XFAD\n    \n  \n\n72 rows × 56 columns\n\n\n\nWe now have a very wide dataframe that contains all the available metadata on each specimen in the RNAseq data from this study. This procedure can be used to join the three types of metadata files for every study in the AD Knowledge Portal, allowing you to filter individuals and specimens as needed based on your analysis criteria!\n\n\n\nSingle-specimen files\nFor files that contain data from a single specimen (e.g. raw sequencing files, raw mass spectra, etc.), we can use the Synapse annotations to associate these files with the appropriate metadata.\n\nExcercise 3: Use Explore Data to find all RNAseq files from the Jax.IU.Pitt_5XFAD study.\nIf we filter for data where Study = “Jax.IU.Pitt_5XFAD” and Assay = “rnaSeq” we will get a list of 148 files, including raw fastqs and processed counts data.\n\n\nSynapse entity annotations\nWe can use the function syn.get_annotations() to view the annotations associated with any file without downloading the file.\n\n# the synID of a random fastq file from our filtered search of fastq files\n\nrandom_fastq = \"syn22108503\"\n\n# extract the annotations as a dict\n\nfastq_annotations = syn.get_annotations(random_fastq)\n\nfastq_annotations\n\n{'sex': ['female'],\n 'assay': ['rnaSeq'],\n 'grant': ['U54AG054345'],\n 'organ': ['brain'],\n 'study': ['Jax.IU.Pitt_5XFAD'],\n 'tissue': ['right cerebral hemisphere'],\n 'species': ['Mouse'],\n 'dataType': ['geneExpression'],\n 'consortium': ['MODEL-AD'],\n 'fileFormat': ['fastq'],\n 'specimenID': ['32043rh'],\n 'dataSubtype': ['raw'],\n 'individualID': ['32043'],\n 'resourceType': ['experimentalData'],\n 'isModelSystem': [False],\n 'isMultiSpecimen': [False],\n 'modelSystemName': ['5XFAD'],\n 'modelSystemType': ['animal'],\n 'nucleicAcidSource': ['bulk cell'],\n 'individualIdSource': ['JAX']}\n\n\nThe file annotations let us see which study the file is associated with (Jax.IU.Pitt.5XFAD), which species it’s from (Mouse), which assay generated the file (rnaSeq), and a whole bunch of other properties. Most importantly, single-specimen files are annotated with with the specimenID of the specimen in the file, and the individualID of the individual that specimen was taken from. We can use these annotations to link files to the rest of the metadata, including metadata that is not in annotations. This is especially helpful for human studies, as potentially identifying information like age, race, and diagnosis is not included in file annotations.\n\n# find records belonging to the individual this file maps to in our joined\n# metadata the annotation value is a string but the individualID column in the\n# metadat is type int so we have to convert\n\njoined_meta[(joined_meta['individualID'] == int(fastq_annotations['individualID'][0]))]\n\n\n\n\n\n  \n    \n      \n      specimenID\n      platform\n      RIN\n      rnaBatch\n      libraryBatch\n      sequencingBatch\n      libraryPrep\n      libraryPreparationMethod\n      isStranded\n      readStrandOrigin\n      ...\n      Generation\n      AnimalMatingStatus\n      Comments\n      jobNumber\n      Microchip Number\n      Diet\n      Birth ID\n      brainWeight\n      animalWeight\n      modelCommonName\n    \n  \n  \n    \n      0\n      32043rh\n      IlluminaNovaseq6000\n      NaN\n      1\n      1\n      1\n      polyAselection\n      NaN\n      false\n      NaN\n      ...\n      N1F3\n      Virgin\n      NaN\n      JAX 5xFAD 12mo\n      288646853.0\n      6%\n      NaN\n      0.503\n      28.76\n      5XFAD\n    \n  \n\n1 rows × 56 columns\n\n\n\n\n\nAnnotations during bulk download\nWhen bulk downloading many files, the best practice is to preserve the download manifest that is generated which lists all the files, their synIDs, and all their annotations. If using the Synapse R client, follow the instructions in the Bulk download files section above.\nIf we use the “Programmatic Options” tab in the AD Portal download menu to download all 148 rnaSeq files from the 5XFAD study, we would get a table query that looks like this:\n\nquery = syn.tableQuery(\"SELECT * FROM syn11346063.37 WHERE ( ( \\\"study\\\" HAS ( 'Jax.IU.Pitt_5XFAD' ) ) AND ( \\\"assay\\\" HAS ( 'rnaSeq' ) ) )\")\n\nAs we saw previously, this downloads a csv file with the results of our AD Portal query. Opening that file lets us see which specimens are associated with which files:\n\nannotations_table = pd.read_csv(query.filepath)\n\nannotations_table\n\n\n\n\n\n  \n    \n      \n      ROW_ID\n

id column, you can link those files to their annotations by the name column. We’ll demonstrate this using the “random fastq” file that we got the annotations from earlier. To avoid downloading the whole 3GB file, we’ll use syn.get() with downloadFile = False to get only the Synapse entity object rather than the file.\n\nfastq = syn.get(random_fastq, downloadFile = False)\n\n# filter the annotations table to rows that match the fastq filename\n\nannotations_table[(annotations_table['name'] == fastq.properties.name)]\n\n\n\n\n\n  \n    \n      \n      ROW_ID\n      ROW_VERSION\n      ROW_ETAG\n      id\n      name\n      study\n      dataType\n      assay\n      organ\n      tissue\n      ...\n      currentVersion\n      benefactorId\n      projectId\n      modifiedOn\n      modifiedBy\n      dataFileHandleId\n      metaboliteType\n      chromosome\n      modelSystemType\n      libraryPrep\n    \n  \n  \n    \n      0\n      22108503\n      1\n      458ff182-d2e4-4c11-a8c0-137ea8d4a816\n      syn22108503\n      32043_GT19_12829_CCGCGGTT-AGCGCTAG_R1_001.fast...\n      [\"Jax.IU.Pitt_5XFAD\"]\n      [\"geneExpression\"]\n      [\"rnaSeq\"]\n      brain\n      [\"right cerebral hemisphere\"]\n      ...\n      1\n      syn2580853\n      syn2580853\n      1634772363992\n      3420438\n      75357319\n      NaN\n      NaN\n      animal\n      NaN\n    \n  \n\n1 rows × 45 columns\n\n\n\n\n\n\nMultispecimen files\nMultispecimen files in the AD Knowledge Portal are files that contain data or information from more than one specimen. They are not annotated with individualIDs or specimenIDs, since these files may contain numbers of specimens that exceed the annotation limits. These files are usually processed or summary data (gene counts, peptide quantifications, etc), and are always annotated with isMultiSpecimen = TRUE.\nIf we look at the processed and normalized data files in the table of 5XFAD RNAseq file annotations we just downloaded , we will see that it isMultiSpecimen = TRUE, but individualID and specimenID are blank:\n\nannotations_table[(annotations_table['dataSubtype'].isin(['processed', 'normalized']))][['name','individualID', 'specimenID', 'isMultiSpecimen', 'dataSubtype']]\n\n\n\n\n\n  \n    \n      \n

    "text": "Download data\nWhile you can always download data from the AD Portal website via your web browser, it’s usually faster and often more convenient to download data programmatically.\n\nDownload a single file\nTo download a single file from the AD Knowledge Portal, you can click the linked file name to go to a page in the Synapse platform where that file is stored. Using the synID on that page, you can call the synGet() function from synapser to download the file.\n\nExercise 1: Use Explore Data to find processed RNAseq data from the Jax.IU.Pitt_5XFAD Study\nThis filters the table to a single file. In the “Id” column for this htseqcounts_5XFAD.txt file, there is a unique Synapse ID (synID).\n\nWe can then use that synID to download the file.\n\ncounts_id &lt;- \"syn22108847\"\nsynGet(counts_id, downloadLocation = \"files/\")\n\n\n\n\nBulk download files\n\nExercise 2: Use Explore Studies to find all metadata files from the Jax.IU.Pitt_5XFAD study\nUse the facets and search bar to look for data you want to download from the AD Knowledge Portal. Once you’ve identified the files you want, click on the download arrow icon on the top right of the Explore Data table and select “Programmatic Options” from the drop-down menu.\n\nIn the window that pops up, select the “R” tab from the top menu bar. This will display some R code that constructs a SQL query of the Synapse data table that drives the AD Knowledge Portal. This query will allow us to download only the files that meet our search criteria.\n\nThe function synTableQuery() returns a Synapse object wrapper around a CSV file that is automatically downloaded to a Synapse cache directory .synapseCache in your home directory. You can use query$filepath to see the path to the file in the Synapse cache.\n\n# download the results of the filtered table query\nquery &lt;- synTableQuery(\"SELECT * FROM syn11346063.37 WHERE ( ( `study` HAS ( 'Jax.IU.Pitt_5XFAD' ) ) AND ( `resourceType` = 'metadata' ) )\")\n\n# view the file path of the resulting csv\nquery$filepath\n\n[1] \"/Users/alinden/.synapseCache/213/126944213/SYNAPSE_TABLE_QUERY_126944213.csv\"\n\n\nWe’ll use read_csv (from the readr package) to read the CSV file into R (although the provided read.table or any other base R version is also fine!). We can explore the download_table object and see that it contains information on all of the AD Portal data files we want to download. Some columns like the “id” and “parentId” columns contain info about where the file is in Synapse, and some columns contain AD Portal annotations for each file, like “dataType”, “specimenID”, and “assay”. This annotation table will later allow us to link downloaded files to additional metadata variables!\n\n# read in the table query csv file\ndownload_table &lt;- read_csv(query$filepath, show_col_types = FALSE)\n\ndownload_table\n\n\n\n  \n\n\n\nFinally, we use a mapping function from the purrr package to loop through the “id” column and apply the synGet() function to each file’s synID. In this case, we use purrr::walk() because it lets us call synGet() for its side effect (downloading files to a location we specify), and returns nothing.\n\n# loop through the column of synIDs and download each file\npurrr::walk(download_table$id, ~synGet(.x, downloadLocation = \"files/\"))\n\nCongratulations, you have bulk downloaded files from the AD Knowledge Portal!\nAn important note: for situations where you are downloading many large files, the R client performs substantially slower than the command line client or the Python client. In these cases, you can use the instructions and code snippets for the command line or Python client provided in the “Programmatic Options” menu."

    "text": "Working with AD Portal metadata\n\nMetadata basics\nWe have now downloaded several metadata files and an RNAseq counts file from the portal. For our next exercises, we want to read those files in as R data so we can work with them.\nWe can see from the download_table we got during the bulk download step that we have five metadata files. Two of these should be the individual and biospecimen files, and three of them are assay meetadata files.\n\n#\ndownload_table %&gt;% \n  dplyr::select(name, metadataType, assay)\n\n\n\n  \n\n\n\nWe are only interested in RNAseq data, so we will only read in the individual, biospecimen, and RNAseq assay metadata files.\n\n# counts matrix\ncounts &lt;- read_tsv(\"files/htseqcounts_5XFAD.txt\", show_col_types = FALSE)\n\n\nA note on file versions!\nAll files in the AD Portal are versioned, meaning that if the file represented by a particular synID changes, a new version will be created. You can access a specific versions by using the version argument in synGet(). This will come in handy here, because the Jax.IU.Pitt_5XFAD study recently made some changes to their individual metadata file that included an inadvertent error. While our curators sort out that error, we will use a a previous version of this file (version 3) to ensure that our metadata joins properly. More info on versions in the AD Portal and the Synapse platform can be found here.\n\n# use the \"version\" parameter to get a previous version of this file\n# the \"ifcollision\" parameter lets us specify what synapser should do if an entity already exists locally -- in this case we want to overwrite the previous version downloaded during our bulk download\nind_meta_object &lt;- synGet(entity = 'syn22103212', \n                          version=3, \n                          downloadLocation = \"files/\",\n                          ifcollision = \"overwrite.local\")\n\n# we can check the version to see what number it is, and if it is the latest version\nind_meta_object$properties$versionNumber\n\n[1] 3\n\nind_meta_object$properties$isLatestVersion\n\n[1] FALSE\n\n\nNow we can read all the metadata files in to R as data frames.\n\n#individual metadata\nind_meta &lt;- read_csv(\"files/Jax.IU.Pitt_5XFAD_individual_metadata.csv\", show_col_types = FALSE)\n\n# biospecimen metadata\nbio_meta &lt;- read_csv(\"files/Jax.IU.Pitt_5XFAD_biospecimen_metadata.csv\", show_col_types = FALSE)\n\n#assay metadata\nrna_meta &lt;- read_csv(\"files/Jax.IU.Pitt_5XFAD_assay_RNAseq_metadata.csv\", show_col_types = FALSE)\n\nLet’s examine the data and metadata files a bit before we begin our analyses.\n\n\nCounts data\n\n# Calling a tibble object will print the first ten rows in a nice tidy output; doing the same for a base R dataframe will print the whole thing until it runs out of memory. If you want to inspect a large dataframe, use `head(df)`\nhead(counts)\n\n\n\n  \n\n\n\nThe data file has a column of ENSEMBL gene ids and then a bunch of columns with count data, where the column headers correspond to the specimenIDs. These specimenIDs should all be in the RNAseq assay metadata file, so let’s check.\n\n# what does the RNAseq assay metadata look like?\nhead(rna_meta)\n\n\n\n  \n\n\n\n\n# are all the column headers from the counts matrix (except the first \"gene_id\" column) in the assay metadata?\nall(colnames(counts[-1]) %in% rna_meta$specimenID)\n\n[1] TRUE\n\n\n\n\nAssay metadata\nThe assay metadata contains information about how data was generated on each sample in the assay. Each specimenID represents a unique sample. We can use some tools from dplyr to explore the metadata.\n\n# how many unique specimens were sequenced?\nn_distinct(rna_meta$specimenID)\n\n[1] 72\n\n\n\n# were the samples all sequenced on the same platform?\ndistinct(rna_meta, platform)\n\n\n\n  \n\n\n\n\n# were there multiple sequencing batches reported?\ndistinct(rna_meta, sequencingBatch) \n\n\n\n  \n\n\n\n\n\nBiospecimen metadata\nThe biospecimen metadata contains specimen-level information, including organ and tissue the specimen was taken from, how it was prepared, etc. Each specimenID is mapped to an individualID.\n\n# all specimens from the RNAseq assay metadata file should be in the biospecimen file\nall(rna_meta$specimenID %in% bio_meta$specimenID)\n\n[1] TRUE\n\n\n\n# but the biospecimen file also contains specimens from different assays\nall(bio_meta$specimenID %in% rna_meta$specimenID)\n\n[1] FALSE\n\n\n\n\nIndividual metadata\nThe individual metadata contains information about all the individuals in the study, represented by unique individualIDs. For humans, this includes information on age, sex, race, diagnosis, etc. For MODEL-AD mouse models, the individual metadata has information on model genotypes, stock numbers, diet, and more.\n\n# all individualIDs in the biospecimen file should be in the individual file\nall(bio_meta$individualID %in% ind_meta$individualID)\n\n[1] TRUE\n\n\n\n# which model genotypes are in this study?\ndistinct(ind_meta, genotype)\n\n\n\n  \n\n\n\n\n\nJoining metadata\nWe use the three-file structure for our metadata because it allows us to store metadata for each study in a tidy format. Every line in the assay and biospecimen files represents a unique specimen, and every line in the individual file represents a unique individual. This means the files can be easily joined by specimenID and individualID to get all levels of metadata that apply to a particular data file. We will use the left_join() function from the dplyr package, and the %&gt;% operator from the magrittr package. If you are unfamiliar with the pipe, think of it as a shorthand for “take this (the preceding object) and do that (the subsequent command)”. See here for more info on piping in R.\n\n# join all the rows in the assay metadata that have a match in the biospecimen metadata\njoined_meta &lt;- rna_meta %&gt;% #start with the rnaseq assay metadata\n  left_join(bio_meta, by = \"specimenID\") %&gt;%  #join rows from biospecimen that match specimenID \n  left_join(ind_meta, by = \"individualID\") # join rows from individual that match individualID\n\njoined_meta\n\n\n\n  \n\n\n\nWe now have a very wide dataframe that contains all the available metadata on each specimen in the RNAseq data from this study. This procedure can be used to join the three types of metadata files for every study in the AD Knowledge Portal, allowing you to filter individuals and specimens as needed based on your analysis criteria!\n\n\n\nSingle-specimen files\nFor files that contain data from a single specimen (e.g. raw sequencing files, raw mass spectra, etc.), we can use the Synapse annotations to associate these files with the appropriate metadata.\n\nExcercise 3: Use Explore Data to find all RNAseq files from the Jax.IU.Pitt_5XFAD study.\nIf we filter for data where Study = “Jax.IU.Pitt_5XFAD” and Assay = “rnaSeq” we will get a list of 148 files, including raw fastqs and processed counts data.\n\n\nSynapse entity annotations\nWe can use the function synGetAnnotations to view the annotations associated with any file without downloading the file.\n\n# the synID of a random fastq file from this list\nrandom_fastq &lt;- \"syn22108503\"\n\n# extract the annotations as a nested list\nfastq_annotations &lt;- synGetAnnotations(random_fastq)\n\nfastq_annotations\n\n$sex\n[1] \"female\"\n\n$room\n[1] \"JAX_MGL373\"\n\n$assay\n[1] \"rnaSeq\"\n\n$grant\n[1] \"U54AG054345\"\n\n$organ\n[1] \"brain\"\n\n$study\n[1] \"Jax.IU.Pitt_5XFAD\"\n\n$tissue\n[1] \"right cerebral hemisphere\"\n\n$bedding\n[1] \"aspen\"\n\n$birthID\n[1] \"RMO1223\"\n\n$climbID\n[1] \"298456\"\n\n$species\n[1] \"Mouse\"\n\n$waterpH\n[1] 2.85\n\n$ageDeath\n[1] 10.81967\n\n$dataType\n[1] \"geneExpression\"\n\n$genotype\n[1] \"5XFAD_carrier\"\n\n$matingID\n[1] \"M-108-17\"\n\n$dateBirth\n[1] \"1521417600000\"\n\n$consortium\n[1] \"MODEL-AD\"\n\n$fileFormat\n[1] \"fastq\"\n\n$generation\n[1] \"N1F3\"\n\n$rodentDiet\n[1] \"0.06\"\n\n$specimenID\n[1] \"32043rh\"\n\n$brainWeight\n[1] 0.503\n\n$dataSubtype\n[1] \"raw\"\n\n$microchipID\n[1] \"288646853\"\n\n$stockNumber\n[1] \"8730\"\n\n$individualID\n[1] \"32043\"\n\n$officialName\n[1] \"B6.Cg-Tg(APPSwFlLon,PSEN1*M146L*L286V)6799Vas/Mmjax\"\n\n$resourceType\n[1] \"experimentalData\"\n\n$rodentWeight\n[1] 28.76\n\n$ageDeathUnits\n[1] \"months\"\n\n$isModelSystem\n[1] FALSE\n\n$materialOrigin\n[1] \"JAX\"\n\n$isMultiSpecimen\n[1] FALSE\n\n$modelSystemName\n[1] \"5XFAD\"\n\n$modelSystemType\n[1] \"animal\"\n\n$nucleicAcidSource\n[1] \"bulk cell\"\n\n$genotypeBackground\n[1] \"C57BL6J\"\n\n$individualIdSource\n[1] \"JAX\"\n\n$individualCommonGenotype\n[1] \"5XFAD\"\n\n\nThe file annotations let us see which study the file is associated with (Jax.IU.Pitt.5XFAD), which species it’s from (Mouse), which assay generated the file (rnaSeq), and a whole bunch of other properties. Most importantly, single-specimen files are annotated with with the specimenID of the specimen in the file, and the individualID of the individual that specimen was taken from. We can use these annotations to link files to the rest of the metadata, including metadata that is not in annotations. This is especially helpful for human studies, as potentially identifying information like age, race, and diagnosis is not included in file annotations.\n\n# find records belonging to the individual this file maps to in our joined metadata\njoined_meta %&gt;% \n  filter(individualID == fastq_annotations$individualID[[1]])\n\n\n\n  \n\n\n\n\n\nAnnotations during bulk download\nWhen bulk downloading many files, the best practice is to preserve the download manifest that is generated which lists all the files, their synIDs, and all their annotations. If using the Synapse R client, follow the instructions in the Bulk download files section above.\nIf we use the “Programmatic Options” tab in the AD Portal download menu to download all 148 rnaSeq files from the 5XFAD study, we would get a table query that looks like this:\n\nquery &lt;- synTableQuery(\"SELECT * FROM syn11346063.37 WHERE ( ( \\\"study\\\" HAS ( 'Jax.IU.Pitt_5XFAD' ) ) AND ( \\\"assay\\\" HAS ( 'rnaSeq' ) ) )\")\n\nAs we saw previously, this downloads a csv file with the results of our AD Portal query. Opening that file lets us see which specimens are associated with which files:\n\n#\nannotations_table &lt;- read_csv(query$filepath, show_col_types = FALSE)\n\nannotations_table\n\n\n\n  \n\n\n\nYou could then use purrr::walk(download_table$id, ~synGet(.x, downloadLocation = &lt;your-download-directory&gt;)) to walk through the column of synIDs and download all 148 files. However, because these are large files, it might be preferable to use the Python client or command line client for increased speed.\nOnce you’ve downloaded all the files in the id column, you can link those files to their annotations by the name column.\n\n# We'll use the \"random fastq\" that we got annotations for earlier\n# To avoid downloading the whole 3GB file, we'll use synGet with \"downloadFile = FALSE\" to get only the Synapse entity information, rather than the file. \n# If we downloaded the actual file, we could find it in the directory and search using the filename. Since we're just downloading the Synapse entity wrapper object, we'll use the file name listed in the object properties.\n\nfastq &lt;- synGet(random_fastq, downloadFile = FALSE)\n\n# filter the annotations table to rows that match the fastq filename\nannotations_table %&gt;% \n  filter(name == fastq$properties$name)\n\n\n\n  \n\n\n\n\n\n\nMultispecimen files\nMultispecimen files in the AD Knowledge Portal are files that contain data or information from more than one specimen. They are not annotated with individualIDs or specimenIDs, since these files may contain numbers of specimens that exceed the annotation limits. These files are usually processed or summary data (gene counts, peptide quantifications, etc), and are always annotated with isMultiSpecimen = TRUE.\nIf we look at the processed data files in the table of 5XFAD RNAseq file annotations we just downloaded , we will see that it isMultiSpecimen = TRUE, but individualID and specimenID are blank:\n\n#\nannotations_table %&gt;% \n  filter(fileFormat == \"txt\") %&gt;% \n  dplyr::select(name, individualID, specimenID, isMultiSpecimen)\n\n\n\n  \n\n\n\nThe multispecimen file should contain a row or column of specimenIDs that correspond to the specimenIDs used in a study’s metadata, as we have seen with the 5XFAD counts file.\n\n# In this example, we take a slice of the counts data to reduce computation, transpose it so that each row represents a single specimen, and then join it to the joined metadata by the specimenID\ncounts %&gt;% \n  slice_head(n = 5) %&gt;% \n  t() %&gt;% \n  as_tibble(rownames = \"specimenID\") %&gt;% \n  left_join(joined_meta, by = \"specimenID\")\n\nWarning: The `x` argument of `as_tibble.matrix()` must have unique column names if\n`.name_repair` is omitted as of tibble 2.0.0.\nℹ Using compatibility `.name_repair`."

Using the RNASeq methods description from the Jax 5XFAD study page in the AD Portal, we expect this data to have equal numbers of individuals sampled at 4, 6, and 12 month timepoints. We can create a new column that captures this info in our joined metadata.\nNote: MODEL-AD studies added to the portal after June 2021 include an ‘ageDeath’ column that makes this simpler.\n\n# load the lubridate package (comes with tidyverse)\nlibrary(lubridate)\n\n# convert columns of strings to month-date-year format\njoined_meta_time &lt;- joined_meta %&gt;% \n  mutate(dateBirth = mdy(dateBirth), dateDeath = mdy(dateDeath)) %&gt;% \n  # create a new column that subtracts dateBirth from dateDeath in days, then divide by 30 to get months\n  mutate(timepoint = as.numeric(difftime(dateDeath, dateBirth, units =\"days\"))/30) %&gt;% \n  # convert numeric ages to timepoint categories\n  mutate(timepoint = case_when(timepoint &gt; 10 ~ \"12 mo\",\n                               timepoint &lt; 10 & timepoint &gt; 5 ~ \"6 mo\",\n                               timepoint &lt; 5 ~ \"4 mo\"))\n\nWe now have balanced samples across sex, genotype, and age:\n\n# check that the timepoint column looks ok\njoined_meta_time %&gt;% \n  group_by(sex, genotype, timepoint) %&gt;% \n  count()\n\n\n\n  \n\n\n\n\n\nSubset covariates\nTo reduce the width of the dataframe, we will subset only the columns that contain covariates we’re interested in exploring further.

This will take a minute – there are over 55k genes in our matrix!\n\n\nPre-translated option:\nFor this demonstration, instead of running biomaRt, which can be unreliable at times and take a long time to render, we will append a dataframe to our counts matrix with short gene names already translated\n\n#ensembl_to_gene &lt;- subset(named_counts, select=c(gene_id, gene_name))\n#write.csv(ensembl_to_gene, file=\"ensembl_translation_key.csv\", row.names=FALSE)\n\nensembl_to_gene &lt;- read.csv(file=\"ensembl_translation_key.csv\")\nnamed_counts &lt;- dplyr::left_join(counts, ensembl_to_gene, by=\"gene_id\")\n\nAre the gene names unique?\n\n# are all the gene names unique?\nlength(named_counts$gene_name) - n_distinct(named_counts$gene_name) \n\n[1] 71\n\n# 71 duplicate gene names\n\nWe need to clean up the humanized gene names and append unique identifiers to the duplicate names.\n\n#The first two genes in the matrix are the humanized genes PSEN1 (ENSG00000080815) and APP (    ENSG00000142192).
