### AD Knowledge Portal: Searching for Data through the Explore Data Feature

AD Knowledge Portal is the front-facing interface for discovering data and tools related to aging, Alzheimer’s disease, and related dementias. These resources are generated by the Accelerating Medicines Partnership in AD (AMP-AD) Target Discovery Program, affiliated National Institute on Aging (NIA) funded programs, and the research community at large. The data can be downloaded and explored, reused, and combined using metadata and annotations.

Synapse
Synapse is the back end, where you create an account, do administrative tasks, and where the resides. If you click on a file in the AD Portal, it will take you to Synapse because that's where it actually lives.


Annotations
File annotations describe properties of a file, including creation date and file version number. File annotations also describe content within files, including source study, individual identifiers, and type of data. By annotating files with information such as consortium, grant, and certain metadata variables, data can be queried both within and across studies in the portal.


What metadata is in the portal?
Metadata provides information about individuals, biospecimens, assays or the files themselves. Some metadata is turned into annotations, some stays in the background.

Mutliple metadata files per study
There are three primary types of metadata files, which provide information about 1) the individual (e.g., human subject, animal, or cell line), 2) the specimens (“biospecimens”) used in assays (e.g., information about brain samples from an individual subject), and 3) assays and assessment variables (e.g., details about RNAseq library preparation or proteomics sample preparation). Dividing the information in separate files decreases the possibility of copy errors and increases the efficiency of adding information about new individuals, biospecimens, and assay details. It also allows you to gather only the information you need for your desired dataset.


What kind of metadata is available?
File annotations describe properties of a file, including creation date and file version number. File annotations also describe content within files, including source study, individual identifiers, and type of data. By annotating files with information such as consortium, grant, and certain metadata variables, data can be queried both within and across studies in the portal.

While many variables are provided as file annotations, additional metadata – including clinical and demographic information on study participants – can be found within a set of csv files that describe the individuals, specimens, and assays.

Combining metadata
In studies where data has been generated from a specimen taken from an individual, the biospecimen metadata file acts as the link between the individual metadata file and assay metadata file(s). These can be linked together by joining the individual and assay metadata files to the biospecimen using the individualID and specimenID, respectively. In studies where data has been generated based on an assessment, the datafile and assay metadata can be directly linked to the individual metadata file through the individualID. For more information, check out our publication The AD Knowledge Portal: A Repository for Multi‐Omic Data on Alzheimer's Disease and Aging. , which provides a step-by-step protocol for use of metadata.



How is metadata used?

Data as a whole set:
1. number of files (not 'datasets')
2. breakdown of teh data by study and data type
	a. show the percentages as you scroll over them
3. list of files
	a. filters across the tipe
	b. sort
	c. download button (arrow)
	d. View terms
	e. study
	f. if you click on a file, you go to synapse
	
4. Icons on top right
	a. search
	b. show/hide graphs
	c. show/hide filters on left
	d. download files
		a. export table of files
		b. Add to download list
		c. programmatically
		d. add/remove table columns
